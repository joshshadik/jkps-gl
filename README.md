# jkps-gl

This library is primarily meant to be used for creating my own small graphics projects.

It currently depends on the following packages to build:
glew
sdl2
tinygltf

For Windows, I would recommend installing these packages through vcpkg and using the vcpkg cmake toolchain file.

So far, it has only been tested on Windows, but I plan on primarily targetting WebGL through WebAssembly in the future.
